All my voicebanks used for my videos (or upcoming ones).

Some voices might not sound good or work properly.

Some voicebanks don't work with certain resamplers. 
You have to download a few other resamplers, specifically fresamp, bkh01, and TIPS. Download links to those down below!

Feel free to use these, however please link back to here if you do so.

Chromatic Scales newly added! Same guidelines apply to them as well.
