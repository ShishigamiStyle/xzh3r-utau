# xzh3r-utau
All my voicebanks used for my videos (or upcoming ones).

Some voices might not sound good or work properly.

Some voicebanks don't work with certain resamplers. 
You have to download a few other resamplers, specifically fresamp, bkh01, and TIPS. Download links to those down below!

Feel free to use these, however please link back to here if you do so.

Chromatic Scales newly added! Same guidelines apply to them as well.

If you want to reccomend scales to make, feel free to do so in the "Issues" tab. I don't take VB requests, as I don't use UTAU anymore. I'll still keep voicebanks up, however.

Be sure to check out these wonderful people who also create VBs/Scales!
